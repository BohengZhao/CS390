#### Lab 1

##### Neural net models.
* Standard Simple ANN 
* Simple CNN
##### Accuracy
* MNIST digit accuracy of 99.44%
* MNIST fashion accuracy of 92.85%
* cifar 10 accuracy of 74.77%
* cifar 100 course accuracy of 57.25%
* cifar 100 fine accuracy of 45.7%

##### Pipeline & misc.
* Code the pipeline to be able to use cifar-10
* Code the pipeline to be able to use cifar-100 fine
* Code the pipeline to be able to use cifar-100 course
* Use matplotlib to create a bar graph showing your accuracy with the standard ANN for each dataset. Save this graph as an image and name the file ANN_Accuracy_Plot.pdf.
* Use matplotlib to create a bar graph showing your accuracy with the standard CNN for each dataset. Save this graph as an image and name the file CNN_Accuracy_Plot.pdf.
* EC: Code in an option to save your network weights to a file for your CNN and ANN, as well as load them. You should be able to run the network again without training.
